# 🌊 Shohojdhara

> **Simplicity in motion.**

Welcome to **Shohojdhara** — an open-source organization dedicated to building tools and systems that make **UI and web development simple, scalable, and seamless**.

---

## 🧠 What is Shohojdhara?

**Shohojdhara (শহজধারা)** is a Bengali word meaning _“simple flow”_ or _“easy stream.”_  
This philosophy is at the core of everything we build — tools that feel **natural to use**, **easy to scale**, and **developer-first**.

We aim to streamline the web development experience by focusing on:

- 💡 **Simplicity** – intuitive APIs, minimal config  
- ⚡ **Speed** – fast setup, fast delivery  
- 🧱 **Scalability** – built for teams and products of any size  
- ♿ **Accessibility** – inclusive by default  
- 🧭 **Consistency** – design & code, always in sync

## 🧩 Featured Project: Atomix

### [🔗 Atomix](https://github.com/Shohojdhara/atomix) – A Modern React Design System

**Atomix** is our flagship design system project:  
- 🎨 Beautiful, reusable React components  
- 🎯 Built with a focus on **scalable, semantic CSS architecture**  
- ⚙️ Customization and theming without utility-class bloat  
- ♿ Accessibility and responsiveness baked-in  
- 📦 Lightweight, maintainable, production-ready

### ✨ CSS Philosophy: SEM + BIO

We believe CSS should be **Scalable, Extensible, and Maintainable (SEM)** — the three pillars that make components **solid, flexible, and future-proof**.  

To achieve this, Atomix follows the **BIO strategy**, combining the strengths of:  

- **BEM** – Block Element Modifier naming for clarity  
- **ITCSS** – Inverted Triangle CSS for scalable architecture  
- **OOCSS** – Object-Oriented CSS for reusability  

This combination provides a **structured, future-ready CSS approach** that avoids the pitfalls of utility-first shortcuts, while keeping styles clean, modular, and easy to maintain.


```bash
npm install @shohojdhara/atomix
# or
yarn add @shohojdhara/atomix
```

> Atomix is perfect for teams that want to move fast without sacrificing quality.
